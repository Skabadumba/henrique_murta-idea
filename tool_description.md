# Awesome Digital History

A scholarly compendium and curated index of resources dedicated to the field of digital history. This repository serves as a methodological guide for academics, students, and cultural heritage professionals engaged in the critical application of digital tools to historical inquiry.

The collection systematically organizes essential resources that facilitate the reconstruction and analysis of the past through computational methods. It is structured to support both the theoretical and practical dimensions of the discipline, providing a foundation for rigorous digital scholarship.

Contained within this repository is a vetted selection of:

*   **Digital Archives & Primary Source Repositories:** Access to structured, digitized collections from institutional and cultural heritage organizations globally.
*   **Analytical Software & Platforms:** A catalog of tools for quantitative analysis, textual analysis, spatial history (GIS), data visualization, and network analysis.
*   **Scholarly Publications & Projects:** References to peer-reviewed journals, seminal digital history projects, and critical commentaries that shape the discipline's discourse.
*   **Pedagogical & Instructional Resources:** Materials supporting the integration of digital methodologies into history curricula and research design.

This repository functions as an essential reference for navigating the evolving landscape of digital historiography, offering a structured entry point for the application of digital methods to historical research and public history.

I found that it was made by 12 people using 4 programming languages. I do not have anything to add.
